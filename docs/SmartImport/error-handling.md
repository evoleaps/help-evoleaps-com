# **Error Handling**

&nbsp;

If your import file contains errors, the app provides detailed notifications to help you understand and resolve the issues quickly.

These error messages appear directly on the **Import Proposal** page, so you can address them before continuing with the import.

&nbsp;

## ‚ö†Ô∏è How Error Notifications Work

1. **Error Detected During Import**  
   If the data is invalid or incomplete, an error notification will be shown immediately on the proposal page.

2. **Click the Notification for Details**  
   Selecting the error message will open a detailed view, allowing you to review the exact issue and correct it as needed.
