# **Regenerating the Import Proposal**

&nbsp;

You can modify how Excel columns are mapped to journal fields before finalizing the import.

This is useful when the automatic matching isn't quite right, or when you want to customize which field receives the imported data.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step: How to Regenerate Column Mapping

1. **Click “Columns Mapped”**  
   After the app generates the initial mapping, select **Columns Mapped** to review the proposed field assignments.

2. **Choose a Different Destination Field**  
   Click on a mapped field you want to change, and select a different destination from the list.

3. **Click “Regenerate”**  
   After adjusting the mapping, click **Regenerate** to create a new import proposal based on your changes.
