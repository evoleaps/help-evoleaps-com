# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How do I install the Smart Import for Excel app?

You can install the app directly from Microsoft AppSource.  
See our [Getting Started guide](getting-started.md) for detailed instructions.

## Do I need to set up templates or mappings?

No. The app uses AI to recognize and match columns from your Excel file automatically — no manual setup or templates required.

---

## What file formats are supported?

The app supports `.xlsx` Excel files.

---

## What happens if some Excel columns are not recognized?

Unrecognized columns will be ignored. The app only imports data that can be matched to Business Central fields. You can review mappings before final import.

## Can I use the app with custom journal layouts?

Currently, the app supports standard journal types in Business Central. For custom journals, contact our support for possible solutions.

## Who can use the app? Are permissions required?

The user must have permissions to read/write in the relevant journal tables and must be able to import data via extensions.  
See [Permission Requirements](permissions.md) for more details.

## Is my Excel data sent to external servers?

No. Your data is processed within the Business Central environment using Microsoft’s secure infrastructure. Column matching is powered by AI, but no data leaves your tenant.

## I uploaded an Excel file but nothing was imported. What should I check?

- Ensure that your Excel file is in `.xlsx` format.
