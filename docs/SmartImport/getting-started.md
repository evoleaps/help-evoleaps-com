You can use it to quickly import data into:

- **General Journals**
- **Cash Receipt Journals**
- **Fixed Asset Journals**
- **Payment Journals**
- **Purchase Journals**
- **Sales Journals**
- **Recurring Journals**
- **Item Journals**
- **Resource Journals**

As well as master data like:

- **Customers**
- **Vendors**
- **Employees**
- **Fixed Assets**

## ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step: How to Import Excel Data

1. **Click Import with Copilot**  
   Locate this action in the ribbon of the journal or table where you want to import data.

2. **Select Your Excel File**  
   In the dialog that appears, click **Attach** or **Import Data from File**, then choose your Excel document.

3. **Review the Data Preview**  
   The app automatically detects and matches columns based on their names. Youâ€™ll see a preview of the records that will be imported.

4. **Confirm the Import**  
   Click **Keep it** to finalize the import. The data will be inserted into the journal or table immediately.

!!! warning "Important"
    The **order** of the columns **Account Type** and **Account No.** in your Excel file matters.  
    Make sure **Account Type** comes **before** **Account No.** to ensure correct field mapping and avoid errors.
