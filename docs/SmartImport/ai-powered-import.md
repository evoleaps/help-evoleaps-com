# What is AI-Powered Import?

Smart Import for Excel leverages AI to streamline and simplify the process of importing data into Dynamics 365 Business Central. Instead of relying on rigid templates or exact column names, the app uses artificial intelligence to interpret the structure of your Excel files.

## Key Capabilities

- **Intelligent Column Matching**  
  The app recognizes column headers even if they differ from the field names in Business Central. For example, "Due Date", "Deadline", or "Payment Date" may all be correctly mapped to the same journal field.

- **No Manual Setup**  
  There’s no need to define templates, mappings, or configurations. Simply upload your file and let the AI do the heavy lifting.

## Benefits

- Reduces manual effort and the risk of errors  
- Makes imports more accessible to non-technical users  
- Speeds up the data entry process

Smart Import’s AI engine is designed to enhance productivity and reduce friction in your daily workflows.
